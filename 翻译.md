8 Secrets to Hosting a Successful Tech Meetup
举办成功科技聚会的八大秘诀

1. Greet your guests at the door
在门口迎接客人
First impressions matter! Your meetup attendees have taken time out of their busy after-work schedules to get themselves to your event; the last thing they need is to have to wander the building in search of your office. First, let your building’s security desk know to expect visitors. Then make things even easier for your guests by greeting them at the door and directing them to the meetup space. A warm welcome makes the transition from workday to evening event a lot smoother.
第一印象非常重要！与会者从百忙之中抽出时间来参会，他们所要做的最后一件事就是找对地方。让前台帮你留意来访者，或者更好的办法是在大门口迎接他们并带领他们到达聚会地点。热情的接待让与会者更好的从日间工作过渡到晚间聚会。

2. Add context to the event with co-branding
与合作商一同营造现场的气氛
Got wall-mounted displays? Put them to good use. Co-branding makes it clear who’s responsible for bringing everyone together and provides a visual reminder for people to be on good meetup behavior. They’re also an opportunity for the companies involved to build valuable name recognition. Make sure to set up and publicize a Twitter hashtag – as we’ve done for the Cloudera user group meetup. This allows attendees to post interesting developments as they happen and widens your audience beyond the scope of the people in the room.
有一个巨大的屏幕吗？好好利用它。用大屏展示合作商，让大家知道是谁召集大家聚在一起，也提醒与会者注意自己的言行举止。这也是与会公司让大家知道自己的好机会。一定要在Twitter、微博上发起话题——就像我们在Cloudera用户大会时做的一样。这让与会者能够分享他们遇到的好玩的事，并且这扩大了聚会的参与面，而不仅仅局限与在现场的人。

3. Provide plenty of snacks
提供许多小吃
No one should go hungry, least of all when they’re in your care as a meetup host. The golden hour for most meetups is right after work and ends well past dinnertime. Hungry people are easily distracted, so maintaining interest goes hand in hand with keeping appetites satisfied. Here we’ve provided a nice charcuterie spread and a healthy selection of vegetables. Trays of small, non-messy snacks are perfect for sharing with strangers while socializing.
不能让你的客人挨饿。从刚下班直到晚餐结束是大多数聚会的黄金时间。饿了的人很容易分心，所以即要让客人享受乐趣也要让他们感到舒适。我们提供了许多美味的熟食和健康的素菜以供选择。与陌生人社交时，一盘小巧而不凌乱的小吃是彼此分享的好选择。
